## The project
This project provides scripts for experimenting with the Origin-Shift Algorithm for maze generation.
I used it in order to make some experimentations on the Origin Shift Algorithm created by [CaptainLuma](https://github.com/CaptainLuma/).

You will find 2 scripts in particular that you will find useful: "interface_script.py" and "data_only_script.py".

`data_only.py` is a command prompt script and `insterface.pyw` is a GUI tool.

The interface is still a WIP so there might be bugs. Note that it will be completely revamped for better ease of use and
flexibility of testing in the future.
