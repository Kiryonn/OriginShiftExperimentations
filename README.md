This project is made for my own testing purpose.
I used it in order to make some experimentations on the Origin Shift Algorithm created by [CaptainLuma](https://github.com/CaptainLuma/).

to run interface_script.py, you need the following dependencies:
- [Python 3.12 or greater](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/)
- [pillow (aka PIL)](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)

The data_only_script.py doesn't require any dependency other than python 3.

You will also need an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, Pycharm Community, or any other that you like to manipulate those files.
