## The project
This project is made for my own testing purpose.
I used it in order to make some experimentations on the Origin Shift Algorithm created by [CaptainLuma](https://github.com/CaptainLuma/).


## Scripts
You will find 2 scripts in particular that you will find useful: "interface_script.py" and "data_only_script.py".

"data_only.py" will let you manipulate a maze through the given functions. You will find an example in it to show how you can use the functions in order to manipulate the maze.

"interface_script.py" will let you vizualize what happens with control over the number of step, the size of the maze, the visualization of the solution, the manipulation of the start/end nodes throught left click on a node, the creation/deletion of origins through the right click on a node and the capture of the current state of your maze into an image. More QoL might be added in the future.


## Dependencies
To run interface_script.py, you need the following dependencies:
- [Python 3.12 or greater](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/)
- [pillow (aka PIL)](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)

The data_only_script.py doesn't require any dependency other than python 3.

You will also need an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, Pycharm Community, or any other that you like to manipulate those files.
